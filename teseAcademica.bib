	abstract = {We provide stronger and more general primal-dual convergence results for Frank-Wolfe-type algorithms (a.k.a. conditional gradient) for constrained convex optimization, enabled by a simple framework of duality gap certificates. Our analysis also holds if the linear subproblems are only solved approximately (as well as if the gradients are inexact), and is proven to be worst-case optimal in the sparsity of the obtained solutions.    On the application side, this allows us to unify a large variety of existing sparse greedy methods, in particular for optimization over convex hulls of an atomic set, even if those sets can only be approximated, including sparse (or structured sparse) vectors or matrices, low-rank matrices, permutation matrices, or max-norm bounded matrices.    We present a new general framework for convex optimization over matrix factorizations, where every Frank-Wolfe iteration will consist of a low-rank update, and discuss the broad application areas of this approach.},

A concise exposition of related constructive fixed point theory is presented, that allows for a wide range of algorithms to construct solutions to problems in optimization, equilibrium theory, monotone inclusions, variational inequalities, best approximation theory, and convex feasibility. The book is accessible to a broad audience, and reaches out in particular to applied scientists and engineers, to whom these tools have become indispensable.},

	abstract = {We propose the elastic net, a new regularization and variable selection method. Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p ≫ n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.},

@article{Gong2011,
	abstract = {Recently, the gradient (subgradient) projection method, especially by incorporating the idea of Nesterov's method, has aroused more and more attention and achieved great successes on constrained optimization problems arising in the field of machine learning, data mining and signal processing. In the gradient projection method, a critical step is how to efficiently project a vector onto a constraint set. In this paper, we propose a unified method called Piecewise Root Finding (PRF) to efficiently calculate Euclidean projections onto three typical constraint sets: ℓ1-ball, Elastic Net (EN) and the Intersection of a Hyperplane and a Halfspace (IHH). In our PRF method, we first formulate a Euclidean projection problem as a root finding problem. Then, a Piecewise Root Finding algorithm is applied to find the root and global convergence is guaranteed. Finally, the Euclidean projection result is obtained as a function of the found root in a closed form. Moreover, the sparsity of the projected vector is considered, leading to reduced computational cost for projection onto the ℓ1-ball and EN. Empirical studies demonstrate that our PRF algorithm is efficient by comparing it with several state of the art algorithms for Euclidean projections onto the three typical constraint sets mentioned above. Besides, we apply our efficient Euclidean projection algorithm (PRF) to the Gradient Projection with Nesterov's Method (GPNM), which efficiently solves the popular logistic regression problem with the ℓ1-ball/EN/IHH constraint. Experimental results on real-world data sets indicate that GPNM has a fast convergence speed.},

	abstract = {Abstract We solve the problem of minimizing the distance from a given matrix to the cone of symmetric and diagonally dominant matrices with positive diagonal (SDD+). Using the extreme rays of the polar cone we project onto the supporting hyperplanes of the faces of SDD+ and then, applying the cyclic Dykstra's algorithm, we solve the problem. Similarly, using the extreme rays of SDD+ we characterize the projection onto the polar cone, which also allows us to obtain the projection onto SDD+ by means of the orthogonal decomposition theorem for convex cones. In both cases the symmetry and the sparsity pattern of the given matrix are preserved. Preliminary numerical experiments indicate that the polar approach is a promising one.

The effectiveness relies on choosing the step lengths according to novel ideas that are related to the spectrum of the underlying local Hessian rather than related to the standard decrease in the objective function. A review of these so-called spectral projected gradient methods for convex constrained optimization is presented. To illustrate the performance of these low-cost schemes, an optimization problem on the set of positive definite matrices is described.},

Our algorithm replaces the top singular-vector computation (1-SVD) in Frank-Wolfe with a top-k singular-vector computation (k-SVD), which can be done by repeatedly applying 1-SVD k times. Alternatively, our algorithm can be viewed as a rank-k restricted version of projected gradient descent. We show that our algorithm has a linear convergence rate when the objective function is smooth and strongly convex, and the optimal solution has rank at most k. This improves the convergence rate and the total time complexity of the Frank-Wolfe method and its variants.},

	abstract = {{A family of variable metric methods for convex constrained optimization was introduced recently by Birgin, Mart{\'\i}nez and Raydan. One of the members of this family is the inexact spectral projected gradient (ISPG) method for minimization with convex constraints. At each iteration of these methods a strictly convex quadratic function with convex constraints must be (inexactly) minimized. In the case of the ISPG method it was shown that, in some important applications, iterative projection methods can be used for this minimization. In this paper the particular case in which the convex domain is a polytope described by a finite set of linear inequalities is considered. For solving the linearly constrained convex quadratic subproblem a dual approach is adopted, by means of which subproblems become (not necessarily strictly) convex quadratic minimization problems with box constraints. These subproblems are solved by means of an active-set box-constraint quadratic optimizer with a proximal-point type unconstrained algorithm for minimization within the current faces. Convergence results and numerical experiments are presented.}},

We demonstrate the universality of scenario‐based methods for providing coherent measures. We offer suggestions concerning the SEC method. We also suggest a method to repair the failure of subadditivity of quantile‐based methods.}

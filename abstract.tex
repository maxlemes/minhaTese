\chapter*{Abstract}

In this thesis, we study variational inequalities and generalized vector equilibrium problems.

In Chapter~\ref{chapter1}, several results and basic definitions of Riemannian geometry are listed; we present the concept of the monotone vector field in Hadamard manifolds and many of their properties, besides, we introduce the concept of enlargement of a monotone vector field, and we display its properties in a Riemannian context.
\medskip

In Chapter~\ref{chapter2}, an inexact proximal point method for variational inequalities in  Hadamard manifolds is introduced, and its convergence properties are studied; see \cite{BatistaBentoFerreira2015_2}. To present our method,  we generalize the concept of enlargement of monotone operators,  from a linear setting to the Riemannian context. As an application,  an inexact proximal point method for  constrained optimization problems is obtained.
\medskip

In Chapter~\ref{chapter3}, we present an extragradient algorithm for variational inequality  associated with the point-to-set vector field in Hadamard manifolds and study its convergence properties; see \cite{BatistaBentoFerreira2015_3}.  In order to present our method, the concept of enlargement of maximal monotone vector fields is used and its lower-semicontinuity is established to obtain the convergence of the method in this new context.
\medskip

In Chapter~\ref{chapter4}, we present a sufficient condition for the existence of a solution to the generalized vector equilibrium problem on Hadamard manifolds using a version of the Knaster-Kuratowski-Mazurkiewicz Lemma; see \cite{BatistaBentoFerreira2015}. In particular,   the existence of solutions to optimization, vector optimization, Nash equilibria, complementarity,  and variational inequality is a special case of the existence result for the generalized vector equilibrium problem.

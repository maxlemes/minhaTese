\section{Risks measures}

In this section we discuss different ways to measure the risk of portfolio.
\begin{definition}
	A portfolio with $n$ assets, $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$, is a vector $x^\top = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)\in \R^n$ where each coordinate $x_i$ is the weight of capital invested in asset $A_i$.
\end{definition}
In finance risk is the possibility of a loss of capital and one way to measure risk is to calculate the probability of that loss happening.

Considering the loss as a random variable we can calculate the standard deviation of its distribution. This standard deviation (or \textit{volatility}) was considered a measure of risk by Nobel laureate in economics, Harry Markowitz in 1952 (see \cite{Markowitz1952}) under the hypothesis of loss has a normal distribution.

Others risk measures are done in terms of loss distribution percentiles. An upper percentile of the loss distribution is called \textit{Value-at-Risk} ($\mbox{VaR}_\beta$)\footnote{$\mbox{VaR}_\beta$ is the percentile of the loss distribution, i.e., with a specified confidence level $\beta$,  $\mbox{VaR}_\beta$ is the lowest amount $\zeta$ such that, with probability $\beta$, the loss is less or equal to $\zeta$.}. For instance, $\mbox{VaR}_{0.95}$ is an upper estimate of losses which is exceeded with 5\% probability. The popularity of $\mbox{VaR}_\beta$ is mostly related to a simple and easy to understand representation of high losses. $\mbox{VaR}_\beta$ can be quite efficiently estimated and managed when underlying risk factors are normally (log-normally) distributed.

An alternative measure of losses is another percentile risk measure which is called \textit{Conditional Value-at-Risk} ($\mbox{CVaR}_\beta$)\footnote{$\mbox{CVaR}_\beta$ is the average loss in the $100(1-\beta)$\% worst case scenarios.}. The $\mbox{CVaR}_\beta$ risk measure is closely related to $\mbox{VaR}_\beta$. For continuous distributions, $\mbox{CVaR}_\beta$ is defined as the conditional expected loss under the condition that it exceeds $\mbox{VaR}_\beta$, see Rockafellar and Uryasev (see \cite{RockafellarUryasev2001}). For continuous distributions, this risk measure also is known as \emph{Expected Shortfall}, \textit{Mean Excess Loss}, \textit{Mean Shortfall}, or \textit{Tail Value-at-Risk}.

\begin{remark}\normalfont\label{re:Normal}
If the loss distribution of a portfolio $x$ is normal, it follows that
\[
	\mu(x)+c\sigma(x)
\]
where $\mu(x)$ and $\sigma(x)$ denote the mean and volatility of the loss associated with portfolio $x$, and $c$ is a constant (see \cite[Chapter 2]{Roncalli2014}). If the portfolio manager has very optimistic forecasts, component $\mu(x)$ may substantially reduce the risk measure. This explains why omitting the mean component is standard practice in the asset management industry.
\end{remark}
% \begin{example}\normalfont
% 	We consider three stocks $A$, $B$ and $C$ whose current prices are respectively $\$ 15.00$, $\$ 25.00$ and $\$ 30.00$. We assume that their expected returns are equal to $30$ bps\footnote{1 bps or one basis point is equivalent to
% 		0.01\% (the hundredth part of 1\%) or 0.0001 in decimal form.}, $50$ bps and $20$ bps on a daily basis and their daily volatilities are $3\%$, $2\%$, and $1\%$ respectively. The asset correlation matrix is given by
% 	\[
% 		\rho = \left(
% 		\begin{array}{rrr}
% 				1.00 & 0.40 & 0.15 \\
% 				0.40 & 1.00 & 0.60 \\
% 				0.15 & 0.60 & 1.00
% 			\end{array}
% 		\right)
% 	\]

% 	We consider a portfolio composed by $100$ stocks $A$, $200$ stocks $B$ and $100$ stocks $C$. The value of this portfolio is $\$ 9,500.00$, being $\$ 1,500.00$ invested in stock $A$, $\$ 5,000.00$ in stock $B$ and $\$ 3,000.00$ in stock $C$, therefore the weights of the stocks in this portfolio are $15.79\%$, $52.63\%$, and $31.58\%$ respectively, so $x=(0.1579;\;0.5263;\; 0.3158)$. The expected loss of the portfolio is $\mu(x) = -30\times0.1579+50\times0.5263+20\times0.3158$, that is, $\mu(x) = -37$ bps. Using the relationship $\Sigma_{i,j}=\rho_{i,j}\sigma_1\sigma_j$ we find the covariance matrix
% 	\[
% 		\Sigma = \left(
% 		\begin{array}{llr}
% 				9.0 & 2.4 & 4.5 \\
% 				2.4 & 4.0 & 1.2 \\
% 				4.5 & 1.2 & 1.0
% 			\end{array}
% 		\right)\times10^{-4},
% 	\] since the volatility of portfolio is given by $\sigma^2(x) = x^\top \Sigma x$, we have that $\sigma(x) = 1.51\%$.

% 	Considering $\alpha = 0.99$, we have $\Phi^{-1}(0.99) = 2.325$ and
% 	$\phi(\Phi^{-1}(0.99))=\phi(2.325)=2.68\%$. Using the equations
% 	$(\ref{eq:var2})$ and $(\ref{eq:cvar2})$ we have

% 	\[
% 		\begin{aligned}
% 			\mathrm{VaR}_{99\%}(x) & = -0.37\% + 2.325 \times 1.51\% = 3.14\%              \\
% 			\mathrm{ES}_{99\%}(x)  & = -0.37\% + \frac{2.68}{0.01} \times 1.51\% = 3.68\%.
% 		\end{aligned}
% 	\]

% 	Risk can also be expressed in monetary terms, in this case,

% 	\[
% 		\begin{aligned}
% 			\mathrm{VaR}_{99\%}(x) & = 3.14\% \times \$ 9,500.00 = \$ 298.30  \\
% 			\mathrm{ES}_{99\%}(x)  & = 3.68\% \times \$ 9,500.00 = \$ 349.60.
% 		\end{aligned}
% 	\]
% 	According to the result of {\rm VaR}, in $99\%$ of the days, the loss will be less than $\$ 298.30$, however in the $1\%$ of the remaining days the {\rm VaR} does not measure how much great can be the loss, this is the role of {\rm CVaR} which indicates that the average loss will be $\$ 349.60$ on the worst $1\%$ days.
% \end{example}


\section{Portfolio optimization}

We consider a universe of $n$ assets. Let $x^\top = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$ be a portfolio and denoting by $R_i$ the return of asset $i$. If $R^\top=(R_1, R_2, \dots, R_n)$  is the random vector of asset returns then the return of portfolio $x$ is given by:
\[
	R(x) = x_1R_1+x_2R_2+\cdots x_nR_n = x^\top R.
\]
If we note $\mu$ and $\Sigma$ the vector of expected returns and the covariance matrix of asset returns, we deduce that the expected return of portfolio $x$ is equal to:
\[
	\mu(x) = x^\top \mu
\]
whereas its variance is given by:
\[
	\sigma^2(x) = x^\top \Sigma x.
\]
The mean-variance portfolio (MVP) of Markowitz (see \cite{Markowitz1952}) consists in maximizing the expected return $\mu(x)$ for a fixed value $\hat{\sigma}$ of the volatility $\sigma(x)$. This can be achieved by solving the problem:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{prob:MVP}
	\min_{x} \, \{- \mu(x)\}, \\
	\mbox{s.t. }\left\{
	\begin{aligned}\nonumber
		\sigma(x) = \hat{\sigma}, & \\
		\mathbf{1}^\top x=1       &
	\end{aligned}
	\right.
\end{eqnarray}
where $\textbf{1}^\top =(1,1,\dots,1)$, and the condition $\mathbf{1}^\top x=1$ means that the capital is fully invested.

A portfolio optimization  problem is defined when we want to minimize (or maximize) a performance measure subject to a set of constraints. Here are some examples of performance measures:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Performance Measures}
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Expected return: $\mu(x)$;
		      \item Volatility: $\sigma(x)$;
		      \item Sharpe Ratio (SR): expected return per unit of risk
		            \[
			            \mbox{SR}(x) = \frac{x^\top \mu - r_f}{\sigma(x)}
		            \]
		            where $r_f$ is the risk-free rate (e.g. interest rate on a Treasury bill);
		      \item Information Ratio (IR): Sharpe Ratio with $r_f=0$;
		      \item $\mbox{VaR}_\beta$ (Value at Risk): quantile of the loss;
		      \item $\mbox{CVaR}_\beta$ (Conditional Value at Risk): expected value of the loss above some quantile.
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Constraints can be:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Constraints}
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Capital constraint: $\textbf{1}^\top x=1$;
		      \item Long-only constraint: $x\geq0$;
		      \item Self-financial constraint: $\textbf{1}^\top x=0$;
		      \item Holding constraint: $\mathbf{I}\leq x\leq \mathbf{J}$ where $\mathbf{I},\mathbf{J}\in\R^n$ are lower and upper bounds of the asset positions, respectively.
		      \item Leverage constraint: $\|x\|_1\leq K$.
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Some known portfolio optimization problems are:

\noindent\textbf{Global Minimum Variance Portfolio (GMVP)}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{prob:GMVP}
	\min_{x} \,\{x^\top \Sigma x\}, \\
	\mbox{s.t. }\left\{
	\begin{aligned}\nonumber
		\mathbf{1}^\top x=1 \\
	\end{aligned}
	\right\}.
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent\textbf{Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio (MSRP)}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{prob:MSRP}
	\max_{x} \,\{\mbox{SR}(x)\}, \\
	\mbox{s.t. }\left\{
	\begin{aligned}\nonumber
		\mathbf{1}^\top x=1 & \\
		\mathbf{0}\leq x \leq \mathbf{1}
	\end{aligned}
	\right.
\end{eqnarray}

We can also combine performances and constraints
\begin{eqnarray}\label{prob:General}
	\min_{x} \,\{\lambda \mbox{CVaR}_\beta(x) - \mu(x)\}, \\
	\mbox{s.t. }\left\{
	\begin{aligned}\nonumber
		\mathbf{1}^\top x=0 & \\
		\mathbf{0}\leq x \leq \mathbf{1}\\
		\|x\|_1\leq K.
	\end{aligned}
	\right.
\end{eqnarray}
where $\lambda$ is a parameter that controls how risk-averse the investor is.

All these problems aim to optimize a performance measure, we will present a new approach where the objective will be the risk allocation.

In this work, we study the SGP method  to solve   constrained convex optimization problems employing  inexact projections onto the feasible set and a general nonmonotone  line search. We expect that this work will contribute to the development of research in this field, mainly to solve large-scale problems when the computational effort of an iteration is associated with the projections onto the feasible set and  the cost of evaluating the objective function. Indeed, the idea of using the inexactness in the projection as well as in the line search,   instead of the exact ones, is particularly interesting from a computational point of view. In particular,   it is noteworthy that the Frank-Wolfe method  has a low computational cost per iteration  resulting in high computational performance in different classes of compact sets, see \cite{GarberHazan2015, Jaggi2013}.  An issue that deserves attention is the search for new efficient methods such as the Frank-Wolfe's and Dykstra's  methods that generate inexact projections.
